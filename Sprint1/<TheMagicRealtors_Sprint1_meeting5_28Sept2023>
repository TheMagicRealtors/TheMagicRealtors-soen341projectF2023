Tasks done during the meeting
The meeting was from 6:30pm until 8:10pm at the laboratory session in the Hall Building at Concordia. All team members were present. Before our scrum meeting, we looked at our 
Sprint 2 planning to see if everyone agrees with what Jenisha and Veronique planned. Then, we all worked on the spreadsheet for the Sprint 2 planning. Jenisha did the priority
section, Veronique the risk section alongside Oviya, Midhurshaan the description section, and Jose and Christa did the difficulty rating section. We then had our scrum meeting
with the TA to discuss what we had accomplished during the week for the project. We plan to meet next Tuesday on October 3rd to start talking about the layout of our website in
preparation for Sprint 2.
