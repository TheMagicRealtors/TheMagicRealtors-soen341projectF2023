## **There are four types of users for this real-estate web application:**
### Homebuyers: They're clients that are looking for a house to buy.  
The web app has a lot of interesting features that make it simpler and faster to find the ideal house. 
For example, the homebuyers can filter through their options to choose the price range, the size (number of rooms and/or dimensions), the area/location, amenities (included or not),...
The homebuyers can also choose the type of the building (villa, apartment, ...) and the year the building was built (if they want an old antique building or a modern industrial house for example).  
One very important feature of this app is that the homebuyers can choose to receive help from a real-estate broker. They also have access to a built-in calculator in the app that allows them to calculate mortgage and estimate the monthly payment for their future property.
