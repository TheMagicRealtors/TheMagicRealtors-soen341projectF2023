Tasks done during the meeting
The meeting was from 1:20pm until 1:50pm at JMSB in Concordia. We decided to meet in person rather than on Zoom as we initially planned. 
All team members were present in person except for Christa who joined on call. We decided how we were going to plan for Sprint 2, to know 
how much every member wanted to get done in Sprint 2. We also picked that we would use mySQL for the database of our website, so we will
all take the time to learn how it works and understand its features. We then used the task breakdown table that Jenisha and Veronique made
to separate what each duo in the team will work on. We only did the separation of the tasks according to the user stories of the Homebuyers 
and the Property Renters since we decided that we would only focus on those user stories alongside with the development of the homepage of 
the website. Once that was discussed and the tasks were separated, the meeting ended.
