Tasks done during the meeting
The meeting was from 1:15pm until around 1:45pm. All team members were present. The goal of the meeting was to discuss the tasks
to complete before our next meeting on Thursday, September 21. We decided to finish the user stories by Thursday so that during the 
lab, we can separate the actual tasks based on the acceptance flow for the users. Since we are six in the team, we divided the work 
as such: Christa and Jose will work together on the user stories of the Homebuyers and Property Owners, Oviya and Midhurshaan will 
work together on the user stories for the Brokers and System Administrators, and Jenisha and Veronique will be the secretaries that 
will write the detailed logs and the meeting minutes of the previous and current meeting.
