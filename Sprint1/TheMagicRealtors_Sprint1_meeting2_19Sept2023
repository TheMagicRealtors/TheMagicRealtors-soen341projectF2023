Tasks done during the meeting
The meeting was from 1:15pm until around 1:45pm at the Concordia Library in a study room. 
All team members were present. The goal of the meeting was to discuss the tasks to complete before our next meeting on Thursday, September 21. 
We decided to finish the user stories by Thursday so that during the lab, we can separate the actual tasks based on the acceptance flow for the users. 
Since we are six in the team, we divided the work as such: Christa and Jose will work together on the user stories of the Homebuyers and Property Owners, 
Oviya and Midhurshaan will work together on the user stories for the Brokers and System Administrators, and Jenisha and Veronique will be the secretaries 
that will write the detailed logs and the meeting minutes of the previous and current meeting.
