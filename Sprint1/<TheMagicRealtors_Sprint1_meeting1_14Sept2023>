Tasks done during the meeting
The meeting occurred during the lab period on September 14, 2023. It was from 6:30pm to 8:10pm. At 7pm, Oviya, Jenisha, Midhurshaan, and Veronique were together in a team, looking for a name for our team. Towards around 7:15pm, Christa joined the team as well. Jose was added too by Christa. We then brainstormed for names together. The name picked was Magic Realtors. We also thought of our logo and certain aesthetic features for our website. We chose a unicorn as our mascot and used a colorful palette for the site as a reference to the rainbow. Once the team was formed and the name was picked, it was around 7:30pm. Then, Christa and Jenisha created the group gmail to be used for the GitHub repository. Christa then made the repository and added the rest of the team members to it. It was at 8:10pm when we finished the meeting because it was the end of the lab period.
