Tasks done during the meeting
The meeting was from 1:20pm until 2:00pm at JMSB. All team members were present in person. The purpose of the meeting was to decide on the layout of the website. 
At first, Christa made a Discord chat for us to use in order to communicate more easily and in a more organized manner and added all other teammates to the group. 
Then, we discussed how we would like our website to be organized. We separated the task of making the website into three tasks: the first task is to create the basic 
“skeleton” of the website, so the homepage mainly.The second task is to add the design and colors of the website. The last task is to add properties on the website. The first task was assigned to Christa and Jose, the
second to Oviya and Midhurshaan, and the third to Jenisha and Veronique.
